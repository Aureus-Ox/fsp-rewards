# Flare System Protocol reward distribution

The repository contains the files describing the reward distribution on Flare networks for each reward epoch.
The structure of folders is `<network>/<reward-epoch-id>`. Each contains three files, as described [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/FTSO-Scaling/blob/main/scripts/rewards/README.md#public-reward-data).

Since the reward epoch 227 on Flare and Songbird, the repository is the authoritative source for reward distribution data which and is used by the Flare's [Signing tool](https://github.com/flare-foundation/signing-tool).

NOTE: previously, the reward distibution data were published [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/FTSO-Scaling/tree/main/rewards-data).
